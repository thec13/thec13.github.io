    <h1>Resume</h1>
    <p>Hi, my name is Chad. I proudly work at Uber as an IT Technician. Before that, I was On-Site IT Technician at Yelp.</p>
    <p>I'm a pretty simple guy. I love my Chihuahuas, Chili and Pepper. I love my friends and family. I love food and trying new things. I love technology (especially the Apple type) and I love sharing my passion for all the above.</p>
    <p>Over the course of my time in both the U.S. Air Force and in Apple Retail, I've proven to be an exemplary professional with unique interpersonal skills and a devout sense of loyalty to both customer and company. I can think analytically and strategically to implement innovative solutions and am highly focused and dedicated when it comes to achieving any task set before me. I have the ability to not only think logically, but also with the heart. My empathy and my compassion when combined with my constant willingness to learn and improve makes me the person I am today: hard working, dedicated, fun professional with never-ending passion.</p>
